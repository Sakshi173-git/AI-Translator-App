# AI-Translator-App
## Description
An AI-powered real-time translation app built using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq AI
This project was developed during my internship at Pinnacle Labs with the goal of breaking language barriers using cutting-edge AI tools. The app allows users to input text in one language and get instant, accurate translations in another â€” all via a clean, user-friendly web interface.
