# AI-Translator-App
## Description
An AI-powered real-time translation app built using Python, Streamlit, LangChain, and Groq AI
This project was developed during my internship at Pinnacle Labs with the goal of breaking language barriers using cutting-edge AI tools. The app allows users to input text in one language and get instant, accurate translations in another — all via a clean, user-friendly web interface.
## Tech Stack
🧠 LangChain – for managing prompts and conversation flow
 ⚡ Groq AI – for ultra-fast translation inference
 🎨 Streamlit – for designing a sleek and responsive frontend
 🐍 Python – to stitch everything together
## Project Highlights
 📌 Built an AI-powered tool that showcases practical applications of machine learning
 📌 Gained exposure to real-time deployment, debugging, and optimization
 📌 Enhanced my knowledge in Python, computer vision, and cloud-based APIs
 📌 Learned how to work in a fast-paced, innovation-driven environment
